A very basic Discord bot written entirely in [Go](https://go.dev) using [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo). I started this project because I have no knowledge of Go and think the best way to learn something is to develop a project. PRs appreciated, I will gradually improve this project in my free time.

I also need a better name for the project.

Invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=applications.commands%20bot&permissions=268561488&client_id=1007010887447625748).
